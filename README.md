# graph-experiment

Playing with MTA data to keep myself refreshed on graph theory.

1. Define modeling assumptions
2. Load GTFS data
3. Construct stops and routes
4. Build graph w typed edges (line vs transfer edge)
5. Infer and attach transfer edges
6. Validate graph (counts, connectivity)
7. Derive graph-based features (degree, betweenness centrality, connectivity, cut-edges)
8. Edge impact regression
9. Evaluate and analyze failure cases
